1,Avalanche Run,29999,/images/avalancherun.jpg,The EarthQuaker Avalanche Run V2 Stereo Reverb & Delay Pedal with Tap Tempo was developed to take floating ambient tones to the next level.,"The Avalanche Run is a dreamy sonic discovery device with up to 2 seconds of delay time and a lush stereo reverb. It features complete control over delay time, repeats, mix and voice (with the tone control), as well as control over the reverb length and mix.

In “Reverse” mode, the delay line is in reverse and the reverb remains in normal mode. In “Swell” mode, the Avalanche Run reacts to your picking dynamics and adds a volume swell to the entire signal path much like manually raising and lowering the volume of your guitar. The EarthQuaker Avalanche Run V2 Stereo Reverb & Delay Pedal with Tap Tempo features an expression jack that can be assigned to one of six different controls using the “EXP” selector switch. It also features Tap Tempo with six different ratios accessed via the “Ratio” selector switch.

2,Plumes,9999,/images/plumes.jpg,"Armed with JFET op-amps, this high-headroom OD is chock-full of chime and clarity.","Many overdrives are a one-trick pony, but not Plumes — its three clipping modes make it one of the most versatile OD stompboxes out there. Mode 1 offers symmetrical LED clipping, supplying you with loads of crunch and compression. This is a great setting for down-and-dirty rock ‘n’ roll tones. Mode 2 is a wide-open op-amp clean boost. This setting dispenses with the soft-clipping diodes altogether, leaving you with a straight op-amp drive that’s perfect for pushing your clean amp into restrained breakup. Mode 3 is an asymmetrical silicon diode arrangement that produces a familiar-sounding drive, but with more clarity and transparency. Plumes covers a lot of ground in a lot of situations; but when we ran it through its paces here at Sweetwater, we found that it works its best magic in front of a dirty amp.",EarthQuaker,Overdrive,Pedal

7,POG 2,24999,/images/pog2.jpg,"Easy to use yet packed with features, this polyphonic octave generator expands the capabilities of electric guitars.","The POG2 is based on the original POG polyphonic octave pedal EHX released more than a decade ago, which earned worldwide acclaim due to its versatility and performance.

From 12-string guitars and orchestral walls of sound to dreamy swells and arpeggios, the Electro-Harmonix POG2 can do it all.The POG2 includes a wide array of functions you can use simultaneously to create the sound you want. First, you can add one and two octaves up to your instrument’s voice as well as one and two octaves down with independent sliders for full control of the resulting voice. A slider for the dry signal of your guitar is also included for a total of five independent controls. The resulting octave mix can make your guitar sound like a simple bass, a bright synth, a five-layered symphonic wall, and anything in between. The possibilities are endless.Adding to this signature functionality, this Electro-Harmonix polyphonic octave generator includes three powerful effects, each with an independent slider for full control of each one. The attack effect acts as a gradual delay for string picking or plucking action and is great for long swells and reverse-like sounds. The low-pass filter slider controls the cutoff frequency for further control of the tone and warmth of the resulting voice mix, which is great for imitating other instruments. Lastly, using the detune slider results in an interesting effect that is reminiscent of chorus and reverb, adding extra thickness to the audio signal.A bright LED at the top of the unit indicates the active combination of these effects, controlled via the dry FX adjacent button that cycles through them. Below, the Q button controls the resonance of the low-pass filter effect, dramatically changing the tonal quality for enhanced versatility.On the right side of the pedal’s face, the presets module allows you to edit the default sounds or create your own combinations of settings for long-term storage and quick recall. Up to eight presets can be customized and stored in the unit’s memory. Cycle through your presets effortlessly with the left footswitch.\",Electro-Harmonix,Filter,Pedal
